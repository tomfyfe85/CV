 ## <a name="about_me">About Me </a>
 
I‚Äôm a recently qualified and passionate Frontend software developer with an eye for what looks good. In my free time I play drums and write a blog about pizzas! 

I'm a former professional musician who discovered coding when times became tough during the pandemic. Before I started practicing and studying music full time, I spent most of my time with computers and particularly enjoyed anything problem-solving based, such as The Legend of Zelda! I was also fascinated by outer space ‚Äì and I still am! Alongside these hobbies and interests I grew up in a creative household, so art and design had a big influence on my development, influencing and encouraging me to explore my own creative interests. During my time at the Maker‚Äôs Academy I found that these two interests could benefit one another ‚Äì for example using having to use CSS and JSX, but also using compomants, hooks and fetching data in React is a lot of fun! So, naturally I found the part of the course that focused on Frontend Development particularly rewarding, and I realised that how things look and feel to use really matters to me. As such, I would love the opportunity to develop these skills further ‚Äì I‚Äôve come to realise that I‚Äôm all about making things look amazing and feel great! I would love to be part of a company that has a passion for design and whose priority is creating new and intuitive user interfaces.

## Work Experience

**Freelance Musician** (2009-2023)  
- My professional music career has included playing with bands at functions and weddings, and going on UK and European tours. Most notably, I have played extensively with the Hackney Colliery Band in addition to various personal projects the UK and Europe and regularly still play in London and around the England professionally in a function band setting. 

**Lizzy's on the Green**(Sept 2021 - Oct 2022 /Makers/ Returned Jan 2023 - on going)  

Upon deciding to appy for Makers I thought it was best to not take on any more performance work and get a job that was flexible and gave me time and head space to prepare for the application process. Teaching and working at this cafe allowed me to have more consistant working hours and a stabler inviroment to get my Ruby up to scratch. I continue to work here now after the course has finished untill I find my first developer role.

**Wooton and Dawe Art & Design Logistics ‚Äì Art Technician** (2014-2021)
- My role involved the installation and transportation of valuable works of art. I was proud to work with the Emily Young, who is regarded as Britain‚Äôs greatest living stone sculptor. The scale of Emily‚Äôs work meant that as a team we had to focus on careful planning and clear communication to ensure everything went to plan,  whilst also keeping in mind the overall look and feel that the artist wanted to convey.  I was also in charge of polishing and maintaining Emily‚Äôs work displayed publicly over London, including works at St. James‚Äôs Church (Piccadilly), Neo Bankside (opposite the Tate Modern) and the Michelin star Green House restaurant, Mayfair.
 
**Burlington Danes Academy - Peripatetic Drumkit Teacher** (2016 - 2023)  
- I taught drumkit to individuals and pairs of students, as well as helping to run school bands.
- The students ranged in ability from total beginners to those taking grade exams and GCSE and A Level students, meaning that I had to tailor my teaching style and technical language according to different levels of experience.  
-  As well as planning lessons in accordance with each pupil‚Äôs ability and progress, we would also work towards regular recitals, concerts and musicals performed at the school. 

**Freelance Television Studio Assistant** (2012-2014)
Due to the nature of my music career at the time, I also worked in the television industry, starting out as a studio runner at Riverside Studios in Hammersmith for shows such as Celebrity Juice. Off the back of this I was offered the job of in-house runner at the studios, which in turn lead to work as a Camera Assistant, ultimately in a full time role at The London Studios. I left the industry in late 2014 to pursue my music career with more focus, as  I came to realise it held more interest to me. 

 ## Skills I Can Bring To The Table

**Communication -**

Both teaching and working as a professional musician in bands is as much about good communication as it is the actual skill you are trying to convey or the song you‚Äôre trying to perform. I learnt the value of conveying ideas clearly and in an adaptive way, and keeping in mind the end goal. As both a teacher and a mentor at Makers, explaining and just discussing topics has been a great way to develop a range of skills, and I am always looking for the opportunity to share information and compare findings with my peers.

**Working under pressure -** 

Whether it is playing the first dance at a wedding with no rehearsal or manoeuvring thousands of pounds worth of art into the correct position under the watchful eye of the artist, I came to learn that a successful outcome really boils down to preparation and communication between the group. Understanding what is at stake ‚Äì the enjoyment of the wedding guests (and the bride and groom who have paid a lot of money to have you there), or the reputation of an artist for example ‚Äì means that I have learnt to get things absolutely right first time. With a combination of ample preparation, good communication and ultimately having trust in my bandmates or colleagues, I learnt to absorb pressure and not let it take over. In tech I believe that for me this translates into not being phased by big, seemingly unsolvable problems. Through preparation, considered thought and calm reasoning, any problem can be solved.


**Emotional intelligence -**

As outlined above, sometimes I'd have a few hours‚Äô notice of a set list with no time for rehearsal. But that was the norm, the expectation was that you‚Äôd have sufficient groundwork at home beforehand. It was quite common to feel like the new guy every time, but when working like this, I found it really important to be able to read the room, form good connections quickly and get an idea of how people were feeling. I find that when people (myself included) find themselves in a new situation, they do their best when they are relaxed and feel welcome, and if they feel intimidated they won't ask for help. On occasions when everyone felt positive and relaxed, everything always went smoother. So this is something I would always try to bear in mind when working with a new group on the course at Makers. 

**Time management and efficiency -**

Working as a freelancer has required me to be organised, dedicated and reliable, all things that would affect my chances of future engagement. It means everything from turning up on time to being fully prepared for the job, and being in charge of managing one‚Äôs own time effectively during the working day.
Throughout my freelance years, I learnt how to efficiently absorb new information, quickly understand direction, communicate well and work towards to the good of the team.  I felt having this experience really benefitted me when working in an agile team environment, which felt very natural for me.

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Oct 2022 - Jan 2023)
- Immersive 16 week boot camp. This was a hybrid cohort of onsite and remote students, and we learnt effective ways to work remotely, frequently pairing up and working in groups. This required learning new skills in teamwork and communication in order to problem-solve effectively. We used agile practices and TDD to ensure a healthy working environment and produce high code quality.


#### Guildhall School of Music and Drama (2009 - 2010)

Master of Music - Jazz Performance (Drum Set)
One of the most fun experiences here was being the drummer in the Guildhall Big Band, playing classic albums such as Mile's Davis's 'Porgy and Bess' and featuring special guests from the UK/International jazz scene on the performance.

#### Middlesex University (2006 - 2009)

BA Jazz(hons) - 2:1
(Drum Set)

## When I'm Not Coding -
I'm still passionate about music and continue to play in my own original projects, one my favourite things to do in my own time is to practice my instrument and make music!
