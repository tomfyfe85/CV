 ## <a name="about_me">About me </a>
 
A passionate Frontend software developer with an eye for what looks good. Drummer and pizza blogger the rest of the time!

I'm a former professional musician who found coding while times got tough during the pandmeic. Before I was into music, I was spent most of my time with computers and particularly enjoyed anything problem solving based, I also loved space and still do! But along side this I grew up in a creative house hold, so art and design were a big part of my up bringing. During my time at the Makers academy I found that these two interests could benefit one another. I really enjoyed Frontend development and how things look and feel to use. It matters to me, I and would love opertunity to development these skills further more about making things look amazing and feel great!
 
 I would love to be part of be part of a company with a passion for design and creating new and intuiative user interfaces.

## Work Experience

**Company Name** (2009-2023)  
Freelance Musician
- Playing functions, weddings, tours and giving private tutition.
- As a side to this career from 2015 I would work causually as a landscape gardener but also as a art technician to british artist Emily Young though
the art logistics/desgin company Wooton and Dawe.
 
**Company Name** (2016 - 2023)  
Peripatetic drumkit teacher - Burlington Danes Academy
- Here I tought individual and double lessons and helped to run school bands.
- Students ranged in ability from total beginners to those preparing for grade exams and GCSE and A LEVEL students.
- We would work towards reular recitals, concerts and musicals in the school.

Along side my music carrer I worked in the television industry from 2012-2014
- I worked as a runner first, working on show like Celebrity juice at Riverside Studios, before becomming the perimant inhouse runner for the studios in late 2012. This leader to work as a junior camera assistant which inturn lead to a full time camera assistant role at The London Studios. I left the industry in late 2014/early 2015 to pursue my music career with more focus. 


Working underpressure - 

Playing the first dance at a wedding, with no rehearsal or knowing the other musicians prior to the performace. This is some thing that was a 
relativly comman experieice. What this really boils down to is preparation and communication between the group. People pay lot of money for the bands at weddings and the first dance is one of the highlights of the day, so you absolutely have to get it right as everyone is listening and watching the dance.
Because myself and everyone else had prepared in our own time suffiecntly and maintained good communication and utimatley trusted each other to make this work and if any mistakes did occur, the first dance's were always a success.

Emotional intelligence -

As above, sometimes you'd be put with people you had never met beofore to play for 2 hours with no rehearsal. It was just upto you to have done the work at home sufficiently. It was quite often to feel like the new guy every time, other times others would be be the new guy. When working like this, it is really important to be able to read the room (so to speak) and get an idea of how people are feeling. I always found that people (myself included) are at their best when they are relaxed and feel welcome if they are new. Maybe if they feel intimidted they won't ask for help (which could be crucial if they are unsure of something), maybe something else is going on that they need to talk about. If every one is feeling postive an relaxed, every thing always went smoother. So this is some thing I would always try to bare in mind when working with a new group.
