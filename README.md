 ## <a name="about_me">About me </a>
 
A passionate Frontend software developer with an eye for what looks good. Drummer and pizza blogger the rest of the time!

I'm a former professional musician who found coding while times got tough during the pandmeic. Before I was into music, I was spent most of my time with computers and particularly enjoyed anything problem-solving based, I also loved space and still do! Along side this I grew up in a creative household, so art and design were a big part of my up bringing. During my time at the Makers academy I found that these two interests could benefit one another. I really enjoyed Frontend development and how things look and feel to use. It matters to me, I and would love opertunity to development these skills further more about making things look amazing and feel great!
 
 I would love to be part of be part of a company with a passion for design and creating new and intuiative user interfaces.

## Work Experience

**Company Name** (2009-2023)  
Freelance Musician
- Playing functions, weddings, tours and giving private tutition and teaching in schools. Most notably, I have played extensively with the Hackney Colliery Band in addition to various personal projects across the UK and Europe and regularly still play in London and around the England professionally in a function band setting. 

- As a side to this career from 2015 I would work casually as a landscape gardener but also as a art technician to british artist Emily Young through
the art logistics/desgin company Wooton and Dawe.
 
**Company Name** (2016 - 2023)  
Peripatetic drumkit teacher - Burlington Danes Academy
- Here I tought individual and double lessons and helped to run school bands.
- Students ranged in ability from total beginners to those preparing for grade exams and GCSE and A LEVEL students.
- We would work towards reular recitals, concerts and musicals in the school.

Along side my music career I worked in the television industry from 2012-2014
- I worked as a runner first, working on show like Celebrity juice at Riverside Studios, before becomming the perimant inhouse runner for the studios in late 2012. This leader to work as a junior camera assistant which inturn lead to a full time camera assistant role at The London Studios. I left the industry in late 2014/early 2015 to pursue my music career with more focus. 

**Skills I bring to the table**

Communication -

Teaching is as much about communication as it is the actual skill you are trying to 
convey. It is important to be able to put across ideas cleary and in an adaptive way where needs be. As a teacher and a mentor at Makers, explaining and just discussing topics is a great way to delvelop ones own skills and I am always looking for the opportunity to share infomation with my peers.

Working under pressure - 

Playing the first dance at a wedding, with no rehearsal or knowing the other musicians prior to the performace. This is some thing that was a 
relativly comman experience. What this really boils down to is preparation and communication between the group. People pay lot of money for the bands at weddings and the first dance is one of the highlights of the day, so you absolutely have to get it right as everyone is listening and watching/filming the dance.
Because myself and everyone else had prepared in our own time suffiecntly and maintained good communication and utimatley trusted each other to make this work and if any mistakes did occur, the first dances were always a success.

Emotional intelligence -

As above, sometimes you'd be put with people you had never met befor to play for 2 hours with no rehearsal. It was just up to you to have done the work at home. It was quite common to feel like the new guy every time, other times others would be be the new guy. When working like this, it is really important to be able to read the room so to speak and get an idea of how people are feeling. I always found that people (myself included) are at their best when they are relaxed and feel welcome if they are new. Maybe, if they feel intimidted they won't ask for help (which could be crucial if they are unsure of something), maybe something else is going on that they need to talk about. If every one is feeling postive an relaxed, every thing always went smoother. So this is some thing I would always try to bare in mind when working with a new group. 

Time management and efficiency -

Being freelance requires one to be organised, dedicated and reliable. It means turning up on time being fully preaprared for the job, and being in charge of managing ones own time effectively.
Through my time as a freelancer I learnt how to learn efficiently, how to quickly understand direction and work towards to the good of the team. 

## Education

#### Makers Academy (oct 2022 - jan 2023)
- Immersive 16 week boot camp. This was a hybrid cohort of onsite and remote students. We had to learn to work remotely effeciently, frequently pairing and working in groups. This required learning new skills in teamwork and communication in order to promlemsolve effeciently. We used agile practices and TDD to ensure a healthy working enviroment and high code quality.


#### Guildhall School of Music and Drama (2009 - 2010)

Master of Music - Jazz Performance
(drum set)
One of the most fun experiences here was being the drummer in the Guildhall Big Band, playing classic albums such as Mile's Davis's 'Porgy and Bess' and featuring special guests from the UK/International jazz scene on the performance.

#### Middlesex University (2006 - 2009)

BA Jazz(hons) - 2:1
(drum set)

## When i'm not coding -
I'm still passionate about music and continue to play in my own original projects, one my favorite things to do is to practice my instrument and make music!
