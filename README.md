 ## <a name="about_me">About Me </a>
 
I‚Äôm a recently qualified and passionate Frontend software developer with an eye for what looks good. In my free time I play drums and write a blog about pizzas! 

I'm a former professional musician who discovered coding when times became tough during the pandemic. Before I started practicing and studying music full time, I spent most of my time with computers and particularly enjoyed anything problem-solving based, such as The Legend of Zelda! I was also fascinated by outer space ‚Äì and I still am! Alongside these hobbies and interests I grew up in a creative household, so art and design had a big influence on my development, influencing and encouraging me to explore my own creative interests. During my time at the Maker‚Äôs Academy I found that these two interests could benefit one another ‚Äì for example using having to use CSS and JSX, but also using compomants, hooks and fetching data in React is a lot of fun! So, naturally I found the part of the course that focused on Frontend Development particularly rewarding, and I realised that how things look and feel to use really matters to me. As such, I would love the opportunity to develop these skills further ‚Äì I‚Äôve come to realise that I‚Äôm all about making things look amazing and feel great! I would love to be part of a company that has a passion for design and whose priority is creating new and intuitive user interfaces.

## Work Experience

**Freelance Musician** (2009-2023)  
- My professional music career has included playing with bands at functions and weddings, and going on UK and European tours. Most notably, I have played extensively with the Hackney Colliery Band in addition to various personal projects the UK and Europe and regularly still play in London and around the England professionally in a function band setting. 

**Barista & Front of House at Lizzy‚Äôs on the Green Cafe (Sept 2021 - ongoing)**
- Excellent communication skills, rapport building and empathy - dealing with customers and getting to know the regulars; understanding their needs so they continue to visit. 
- Multi-tasking to give a high standard of service - being across orders, coffee-making and food prep, ensuring customers received their items in a timely fashion. 

**Art Technician - Wootton and Dawe Art & Design Logistics ‚Äì ¬†(2014-2021)**
- Project management, forward planning, logistics & working reactively - installing, transporting and maintaining valuable sculptures by Emily Young in a small team.
- Building good team rapport and a trusting relationship with Emily - preparing sculptures for sale and exhibitions independent of input from Emily, who grew to trust my opinion when it came to hands-on preparation and the staging of a sculpture, which were often worth over ¬£100k.  
 
**Peripatetic Drum kit Teacher - Burlington Danes Academy¬†(2016 - 2023)**

- I taught drums to individuals students of all levels, meaning I was constantly adapting and tailoring lesson plans. I approached each lesson empathically but efficiently, and with good time management to get the most out of the contact time.
- Monitoring students progress, interacting with parents and heads of department - giving and accepting feedback and supporting students as they progressed. 
- I devised new interpretations of popular music repertoire to keep students engaged, and coach them to perform these live to a professional level (eg arranging a Wu-Tang Clan song for a brass-led jazz ensemble).  



**Freelance Television Camera Assistant¬†- Riverside Studios & TLS (2012-2014)**
- Learning a camera‚Äôs spec in detail, I learnt to absorb and process this technical information quickly and efficiently, to prepare correctly for lives studio records (Eg The X Factor, TV & Film Baftas).
- Working intuitively to pre-empt the needs of my camera operator was key to ensuring a solid working relationship - I had to be accountable for whatever call I made. 

 ## Skills I Can Bring To The Table

**Communication -**

Both teaching and working as a professional musician in bands is as much about good communication as it is the actual skill you are trying to convey or the song you‚Äôre trying to perform. I learnt the value of conveying ideas clearly and in an adaptive way, and keeping in mind the end goal. As both a teacher and a mentor at Makers, explaining and just discussing topics has been a great way to develop a range of skills, and I am always looking for the opportunity to share information and compare findings with my peers.

**Working under pressure -** 

Whether it is playing the first dance at a wedding with no rehearsal or manoeuvring thousands of pounds worth of art into the correct position under the watchful eye of the artist, I came to learn that a successful outcome really boils down to preparation and communication between the group. Understanding what is at stake ‚Äì the enjoyment of the wedding guests (and the bride and groom who have paid a lot of money to have you there), or the reputation of an artist for example ‚Äì means that I have learnt to get things absolutely right first time. With a combination of ample preparation, good communication and ultimately having trust in my bandmates or colleagues, I learnt to absorb pressure and not let it take over. In tech I believe that for me this translates being able to solve any problem through preparation, considered thought and calm reasoning. I put this to particularly good use in our final project when I succesfully change the button functionality of the app the night before our deadline. 


**Team work -**

As outlined above, sometimes I'd have a few hours‚Äô notice of a set list with no time for rehearsal. But that was the norm, the expectation was that you‚Äôd have sufficient groundwork at home beforehand. It was  common to feel like the new guy every time, but when working like this, I found it important to to read the room, form good connections quickly and get an idea of how people were feeling. I find that when people (myself included) find themselves in a new situation, they do their best when they are relaxed and feel welcome, and if they feel intimidated they won't ask for help. This is something I would always bear in mind when working with a new group on the course at Makers - if I noticed someone had not contributed i'd make a point of asking thier opinion.

**Time management and efficiency -**

Working as a freelancer has required me to be organised, dedicated and reliable, all things that would affect my chances of future engagement. It means everything from turning up on time to being fully prepared for the job, and being in charge of managing one‚Äôs own time effectively during the working day.
Throughout my freelance years, I learnt how to efficiently absorb new information, quickly understand direction, communicate well and work towards to the good of the team. These skills benefitted me at Makers, for example I was well organinsed and preapre work for demonstrations at our final project standups.
